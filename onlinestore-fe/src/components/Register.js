// component should show a message to owners only that an existing owner must register a new owner

// try to use this component for both owners and customers
// if current user is an owner, show a message that says they can register ...


// since owners can register EITHER a new customer OR a new owner:
//    owners ONLY should see a check box indicating that they want to register another owner
//    by default that checkbox should be unchecked
//    the FIRST TIME THE APP IS USED, the checkbox should be checked off
